# Markov Decision Processes with Imprecise Probabilities toolkit

This is a toolkit used in [my Master Thesis](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-21012015-083016/en.php) to run algorithms with MDP-IPs (Markov Decision Processes with Imprecise Probabilities).

It is based on the works of my advisor [PhD Thesis](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-28112010-095311/en.php) and the works of the professor [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) on factored MDPs with RDDL.

Required software to run this application:
 - graphviz
 - ampl, with the solver minos
